# Project3-fire-Data

# Project Overview
Working with data from the Terra and Aqua satellites that compose two thirds of NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS), we are exploring the relationship between geography and fire intensity since 2022.  Studying the relationships between fire and location over time – understanding where they take place most frequently – provides us the ability to make a more informed decision about what mitigation efforts may be needed to help minimize risk based on locale.

# How to Use Flask
1. open to jupyter notebook and run "Fire Data Visualization-data.ipynb"
2. open terminal in the same directory and run "Flask Fire Data- data.py"
3. Open the site that the terminal suggests "http://127.0.0.1:5000"
4. The data shows when put "/data" at the end.

# How to Use Html
Locally host the project and use the following endpoints to access the visualizations:
/data
/3D
/US
/heatmap
/frp
/dropdown

# Ethical Considerations 
Because the information discussed is based on light and radiation measurement of geophysical phenomena rather than information about individuals, there is little concern about the consent of those whose data is gathered. The primary ethical consideration would be any action taken to distribute resources based on the findings. Providing emergency resources selectively can leave those in need without valuable assistance, so any action taken as a result of this analysis should thoroughly evaluate potential harm caused by inaction in specific locales

# Data Sources
All source data is from NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) via https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/download/. To view the Readme.txt for this dataset, please visit https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/download/Readme.txt

The youtube video at "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oht6cf-Acl0&t=480s" was used as a template for "Global Visualization".
"(https://stackoverflow.blog/)" was used to "heatmap.3D" to create 3D Heatmap in python.

"CHATGPT" was used to trobleshoot "JavaScript Visualization Code2.js" to create the functional drop down menu.
